# Walkthrough — every command, in the order a real adoption flows

This document simulates vertical-slices-md-dev-kit end-to-end on one feature. It exercises every command in the spec at least once, in the order an actual adopter would touch them. Console output and file-system actions are both shown.

**Use this when:**
- You've finished [`ADOPTION.md`](./ADOPTION.md) and want to see what the full pipeline looks like.
- You're explaining vertical-slices-md-dev-kit to a stakeholder and want one continuous example instead of jumping between sections of the spec.
- You're implementing a command and want a reference for the expected output shape.

**Scenario:** Solo dev bootstraps a fresh repo called `clickcount` and ships the `demo-counter` feature (an HTTP click-tracking endpoint, the same example feature shipped in [`example/`](./example/)). The arc spans 7 days of wallclock.

**Honesty notice:** the commands below are simulated against the spec contracts. The reference scripts in [`scripts/`](./scripts/) implement the Stop hook; the orchestration commands (`/vskit:implement`, `/vskit:score`, `/vskit:critique spec`, etc.) are spec-described but not yet shipped as runtime binaries. The output shapes are what they will produce.

## `/vskit:clause add demo-counter "..." --severity=...`

The spec-grill produced 5 decisions, three of which encode **invariants** that no single AC can test on its own. The dev formalizes them as clauses now (before any code exists) so future implementation can be checked against them continuously.

```
$ /vskit:clause add demo-counter "Client IP addresses must never appear in log lines" --severity=high

[clause add] Applies frontmatter: appending 'clauses' → [dbschema, interface-contracts, clauses]
[clause add] creating docs/features/demo-counter/CLAUSES.md (was missing)
[clause add] appending CLA-01 (severity High)
[clause add] running baseline /vskit:clause check demo-counter CLA-01
  spec check  → PASS (94%) — anchored in SPEC §3 AC-07, §4 Security, DECISIONS D-03
  code check  → INDETERMINATE (no implementation yet; deferred)

CLA-01 created. Code check will be meaningful after /implement runs.

$ /vskit:clause add demo-counter "All campaign strings must be NFC-normalized before any DB write" --severity=medium
  → CLA-02 added · spec PASS 96% · code INDETERMINATE (no code yet)

$ /vskit:clause add demo-counter "Migration M-01 must be idempotent via the migration runner's dedup" --severity=medium
  → CLA-03 added · spec PASS 88% · code INDETERMINATE (no code yet)

[clause add] 3 clauses now active for demo-counter (all baseline INDETERMINATE on code).

## `/vskit:clause check demo-counter`

The dev re-checks clauses against real code now that the implementation has landed. CLA-01 was INDETERMINATE on Day 2 (no code) — it now has something to grade against.

```
$ /vskit:clause check demo-counter

[clause check] scorer: security-specialist
[clause check] re-checking 3 active clauses against HEAD (b9e4d22)

  CLA-01  "Client IP addresses must never appear in log lines"  [High]
    spec  → PASS  (94%) — anchors unchanged
    code  → FAIL  (92%) — server/click/handler.rs:42 logs req.peer_addr() directly,
                         bypassing logger.rs. Same root cause as AC-07 drift.
    transition: INDETERMINATE → FAIL

  CLA-02  "All campaign strings must be NFC-normalized before any DB write"  [Medium]
    spec  → PASS  (96%)
    code  → PASS  (88%) — normalize_campaign() at validation.rs:12 is the single chokepoint;
                         one cfg(test) bypass noted but not live.
    transition: INDETERMINATE → PASS ✓

  CLA-03  "Migration M-01 must be idempotent via the migration runner's dedup"  [Medium]
    spec  → PASS  (88%) — runner dedup referenced in DBSCHEMA.md migrate.rs callout
    code  → PASS  (85%) — schema_migrations table prevents re-run
    transition: INDETERMINATE → PASS ✓

Summary: 1 FAIL · 2 PASS
Ship-gate effect: HARD BLOCK (CLA-01 is High + FAIL + 92% confidence ≥ 80%)
exit code: 1
```

**The hard block.** CLA-01 escalates the demo-counter ship status from "soft block on composite/dim floors" to "hard block from a High-severity clause" per §10.3 v1.8. Even if every score floor were cleared, deployment would refuse until CLA-01 lands PASS — or until the dev downgrades its severity with a written rationale (audit-trail) or removes it entirely.

## `/vskit:show-backlog`

```
$ /vskit:show-backlog --status=open

Open tasks across all features (Pending + In Progress + In Review):

demo-counter:
  T-06  Structured logging (campaign; scrub IPs)   devops-lead    In Progress  AC-07 (D-03)
  T-07  Down migration for M-01                    db-architect   In Review    AC-08 (D-04)

```

## `/vskit:next-task`

```
$ /vskit:next-task

Highest-priority unblocked task: T-08 (High)
  Unit + integration tests (TC-01..TC-04) — testing-lead — demo-counter
  Blocks: nothing
  Blocked by: nothing
  Closes: Test Coverage floor (6 → ≥7 needed for ship)

Recommended next action: complete T-08 to clear the Test Coverage floor.
```

## `/vskit:next-task`

```
$ /vskit:next-task

State: demo-counter is In Development with 3 dims below floor (Logging 5, TC 6, NFR 6).
Security and Documentation are above floor.

Sequence I'd run:
  1. Finish T-06 (Logging) — single highest score lift, single owner
  2. Finish T-08 (Test Coverage) — clears TC floor, unblocks T-09
  3. Run T-10 (load test) — confirms NFR p95
  4. /vskit:score feature demo-counter --force (re-evaluate)
  5. /vskit:check deploy (expect gate pass)

Estimated wallclock: ~4 hours focused work for T-06+T-08; T-10 is async.
```

## `/vskit:open-questions`

                Q-02: non-ASCII campaign names? → Resolved (yes, NFC-normalize)

# Clauses — the `/vskit:clause` workflow (v1.8)

> **Reading guide.** The day-by-day arc above already exercises `/vskit:clause add` (Day 2), `/vskit:clause check` (Day 5 and Day 7), and `/vskit:clause audit` (Day 6). This section is a **complete command reference** — it re-shows those commands for completeness and adds the four the natural arc doesn't reach: `/vskit:clause list`, `/vskit:clause update`, `/vskit:clause remove`, `/vskit:clause check-all`. Skip down to `/vskit:clause list` or `/vskit:clause update` if you've already followed the arc.

Clauses (§4.7) cover invariants the existing artifacts cannot: properties that hold *across the codebase*, not per-request behavior (ACs) or measured numbers (NFRs). The dev opts in by adding `clauses` to `Applies:`. Five per-feature commands plus two global commands manage them.

In the demo-counter arc above, AC-07 surfaced a drift: `handler.rs:42` logs `peer_addr`, violating D-03. An AC test catches it once; a **clause** formalizes "client IPs must never appear in logs anywhere" so future code can't reintroduce the same pattern under a different AC.

## `/vskit:clause add demo-counter "Client IP addresses must never appear in log lines" --severity=high`

```

## `/vskit:clause update demo-counter CLA-03 "Migration M-01 must be idempotent via the migration runner's dedup"`

```
$ /vskit:clause update demo-counter CLA-03 "Migration M-01 must be idempotent via the migration runner's dedup"

[clause update] moving old CLA-03 row to Removed/Superseded with Supersedes: CLA-04
[clause update] new clause CLA-04 written with updated rule text
[clause update] running baseline /vskit:clause check demo-counter CLA-04

  spec  → PASS  (88%) — runner dedup is referenced in DBSCHEMA.md migrate.rs callout
  code  → PASS  (85%) — runner enforces

[clause update] CLA-03 superseded by CLA-04 (PASS @ 85%)
```

**Why update instead of remove?** The original rule ("must be idempotent") was too strict given the runner architecture. The new rule narrows the invariant to where it's actually enforced. The audit trail in `## Removed / Superseded Clauses` shows what changed and why.

## `/vskit:clause remove demo-counter CLA-04` (hypothetical — if the rule is no longer invariant)

```
$ /vskit:clause remove demo-counter CLA-04

[clause remove] reading current state of CLA-04
  Active record: PASS @ 85% (code) · PASS @ 88% (spec)
Reason for removal (free text, will appear in audit trail): _
```

Confirm with a reason; the row moves to `## Removed / Superseded Clauses` with the final verdict preserved.

## `/vskit:clause audit` (global, read-only)

```
$ /vskit:clause audit

[clause audit] scanning docs/features/ for CLAUSES.md

  ingest         — no CLAUSES.md (clauses not in Applies)
  query          — no CLAUSES.md (clauses not in Applies)
  demo-counter   — 3 active clauses
                   CLA-01: High,   PASS 96%/96%  — OK
                   CLA-02: Medium, PASS 88%/96%  — OK
                   CLA-04: Medium, PASS 85%/88%  — OK
                   (1 row in Removed/Superseded — audit-only)

Summary across repo:
  0 FAIL
  0 INDETERMINATE
  0 stale
  3 clauses passing
  1 historical record (Removed/Superseded)

exit code: 0
```

## `/vskit:clause check-all` (run all checks, write results)

```
$ /vskit:clause check-all

[clause check-all] iterating features with clauses in Applies

  demo-counter (3 clauses) ... 3 PASS  → exit 0

Repos with clauses: 1
Total clauses checked: 3
Aggregated exit code: 0
```

**Aggregation rule:** non-zero exit if **any** feature reports High/Critical FAIL @ confidence ≥ 80%. A single hard-blocking clause anywhere in the repo fails the whole run.

## How clauses fit into the lifecycle

| Phase | Clause action |
|---|---|
| Critique | When a specialist proposes an invariant that can't be testably ACd, raise a clause instead — `/vskit:clause add` from inside the critique flow |
| Implementation | `/vskit:clause check` after each batch of commits to confirm the invariant still holds |
| Ship gate | `/vskit:check deploy` reads CLAUSES.md per feature; High/Critical FAIL = hard block, Medium FAIL or stale = soft block (§10.3 v1.8) |
| Post-ship | `/vskit:clause audit` weekly to catch staleness; `/vskit:clause check-all` after dependency upgrades or major refactors |

# Key invariants reinforced across the trace

- **Lifecycle states (Backlog → Shipped) are never hand-edited** — they emerge from TASKS rows, score values, score history. `/vskit:project-status` reads the truth at any moment.
- **Every commit has a `Closes-AC:` trailer**, audited by `/vskit:audit-traceability`. Six months from now, every line walks back to an AC.
- **Every decision has a DECISIONS row whose Updates column is non-empty.** No orphans. Otherwise Documentation score drops and ship is gated.
- **`/vskit:score` is cached** — re-running after a clean diff prints `[cached]`. Re-runs after code/spec changes invalidate.
- **Soft block ≠ block.** `/vskit:deploy` will prompt and accept a waiver, but the waiver is appended to `SCORE.md ## Score History` with date, deployer, and reason. Auditable bypass.
- **Token estimates always prefixed `~`.** `/vskit:report-overhead` shows the budget; two breach weeks force a drop or scope reduction.

That's every command in the spec exercised once, in the order a real adoption flows through them.

## Where to go from here

- **Try it on your repo.** [`ADOPTION.md`](./ADOPTION.md) is the under-an-hour tutorial; this file is the reference for what comes after.
- **Inspect a real populated feature folder.** [`example/features/demo-counter/`](./example/features/demo-counter/) holds the same feature this walkthrough simulates, fully filled out.
- **Read the spec.** [`vertical-slices-ai-framework.md`](./vertical-slices-ai-framework.md) §3.1 has the canonical pipeline diagram and §8 has every command contract.
